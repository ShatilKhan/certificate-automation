Automatic custom certificate generationðŸ“œ

# Project Structure

A few standard templates for design. The problem with existing certificate generators is that they mostly just take in the name of the receiver. Often times certificates are granted in collaboration with other entitites. Hence a main company logo along with a Collaboration logo input is required.

Input fields:
- Name of receipant
- Issuer Logo
- Collaborator Logo
- Text Description
- Pic (optional)

Another area of use would be Poster design for congratulating on promotions & achievements for future work.

I don't even know if I'll ever work on this idea, but just writing it down at least makes a good leverage to come back to it.
